We should first determine what environment we think our diner would thrive in. Given the Chinese family nature, we should prefer areas in which prices ($), expectations (reviews), and cleanliness (health score) are relatively low. The small style means that it would be unlikely to compete with larger, established businesses. 

Preliminary data analysis in Figure 1 shows that Chinese restaurants make up a substantial part of the dataset alongside other Asian cuisines. 



These Chinese restaurants are primarily distributed in Little Italy, Chinatown, Harlem, the Village, and Morningside Heights as seen in Figures 2 and 4.





So letâ€™s consider the other factors. As can be seen in figure 5-7, all of our factors - low prices, sub-par health scores, and low ratings - all seem to be found uptown in the Harlem-Morningside Heights-Manhattanville area above Central Park.





This brings me to two recommendations: 

Manhattanville: The area around CCNY gets the top spot by excelling in all of the categories above. Furthermore, the college atmosphere may be good for business.
East Harlem: East Harlem also excels, but the relatively high density of Chinese restaurants makes it a second choice. 


One potential difficulty is that while we chose areas with fewer Chinese restaurants, this might indicate a lower demand for Chinese food in the area and thus worse business. A future step would be to supplement this data with consumer information to get a better grasp of what consumers want in each district.
